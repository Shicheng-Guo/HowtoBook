## Differential Gene expression (DEG) for FLS from RA 

339 DEGs were derived from 11 RA FLS vs 11 normal control by RNA-seq published in Nature Communication in 2018

Suppose LLDT-8 affect the therapy of RA, then LLDT-8 should recover parts of these 339 genes. 

Xinpeng mentioned a paper published in ART in 2016 about lncRNA expression in FLS from RA patients. 

interesting thing is they mentioned 10 samples were collected in the study. However, when I check the data in GEO: GSE83147, only 3 samples were used for the lncRNA-array.
