## How to prepare introduction
(1) Start from a general problem to connect to more general readers. (2) Use logic to convince the readers of what they need to know, and the specific questions need to be answered in order to solve the general problem. 

A typical rhetoric pattern for the first part of the introduction is like “The importance of problem X has been widely recognized. A has found that… B has found that…. And that is why C is critical for solving the problem X. However, it remains unclear whether C is true or not.”

(1) To specify our proposed solutions, how we will contribute, how we will create value for the identified research questions. The key is to demonstrate the clarity of our plan by providing an overall goal and well-defined research objectives of the current study. (2) The overall goal usually echoes the general problem, and the research objectives usually echoes the research questions we raised in the first part of the introduction. (3) Optionally, we may further assert a clear rationale to explain how our objectives lead to the overall goal, and that rationale echoes the rationale that connects the research questions with the general problem. 

A typical rhetoric pattern for the second part of the introduction is like “Our long term goal is to reach A. Our objectives in this study is to obtain B. Our rationale for this study is that B will lead to A.”
