## Smart Pubmed Showing Impact Factor Distribution for the Returned Papers. 
Recently, some colleauges ask me how to only focus on publications of high quality. I think it is a good question, therefore, I prepare a high-quality-journal list for PubMed searching. Here is how it works. Pubmed provide 'filter' function and you can log in your NCBI/Pubmed account and then you can set the filters with "manage filter". Try to search anything in Pubmed and then "manage filter" will come out on the right side. The last step is clicking "manage filter" and then "creat custom filter". I have prepared these filters for you within my github NCBIfilter folder. What you need to do is copy the journal id and then give it a name. Don't forget to select them after you creat them or else they will not appeared in the right side of the Pubmed. You will observe the exact styles what I have created as the bottom figure. As the figure showed, there were only 149 studies of high qualities which would save lots of time for you to follow the methylation research Frontline.

Note: the IF is based on 2019

1. log in your NCBI with your usrname and passwd: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/

2. try to search anything and then you will find `Manage Filters` in the right side of the page. 

3. click `Manage Filters` and `creat custom filter`

4. [IF30](IF30.txt) represents all the journals whose impact factor > 30. Now copy the contents to custom filter and save as IF30

5. same to IF20, IF10, IF5 and IF3.  IF20 represents journals : 20 < impact factor  <30
