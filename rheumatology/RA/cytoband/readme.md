Genetic Association SNPs from GWAS-Meta analysis (20190208)

You will find there are some non-related GWAS records come out if you use [grep](Grep_RA.GWAS_Catalog.md) to achieve RA-GWAS-SNPs.

[128 SNPs](../GWAS/GWAS-Meta-128-SNPs.20190208.vcf) have been identified in previous meta-analysis to GWAS-RA data. However, we can find there are more than GWAS-Catalog RA-SNPs were recorded.
