Control subjects were selected according to the liability model described previously.  In  order  to  capture  the  genetic component  that  is  specific  for  RA  and  different  from  other chronic  arthritides,  we  selected  a  group  of  200  patients  with non-RA  inflammatory  arthritis  (non-RA).  This  group  of  patients  and  those  with  early  RA  were  selected  from  the  same early arthritis clinics, and the non-RA group comprised spondylarthritis  (34%),  undetermined  arthritis  (26%),  psoriatic arthritis (20%), connective tissue disorders (15%), and other less common  inflammatory  arthropathies  (5%).  To increase the   efficiency   of   our   study,   we   selected   a   group   of   200 individuals with the lowest liability for RA or any other chronic inflammatory disease, whom we here describe as hyper-normal control subjects.  Using  the  randomized  control  collection  of IRCIS  BioBank  (Hospital  San  Joan  de  Reus,  Tarragona, Spain),  we  selected  only  those  individuals  whose  age  placed them at risk of RA (40 years old), were Caucasian, and had a 3-generation Spanish origin. We reduced the genetic liability in this group by excluding those individuals with 1 first-degree relative with a chronic inflammatory disease (including autoimmune diseases). All 4 subgroups had the female-to-male sex distribution (3:1 ratio) that is characteristic of RA (21).
