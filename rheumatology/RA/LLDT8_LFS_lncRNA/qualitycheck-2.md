In checking your manuscript submitted to Scientific Reports it has come to our attention that the following must be addressed before we can process your submission: 

-- Many thanks for sending us your authorship update form. However, please could you ensure the "Change to author list" section includes a brief description of the changes made to your author list? Further, please ensure all signatures on the form are fully legible. We would be grateful if you could complete the form in full, ensuring all authors have signed, and then upload it to our system as a separate Related Manuscript file or return it by email. 

-- Please ensure that any supplementary information is uploaded as a single PDF file (where possible) separate from the article file, adhering to the following requirements: 

- Please ensure any supplementary information includes a title page with the title of the manuscript and the author list. 

- Supplementary figures should not be uploaded as separate figure files, and supplementary information, including supplementary legends, should not be included in the main article file. 

- Please note that large supplementary datasets can be included as separate Excel documents and should be uploaded as a “Supplementary Info” or “Supplementary Dataset” file. 

- Please note the Supplementary Information will be published as is, without modification or typesetting. Consequently, please do not highlight changes with colours or otherwise in the SI. 

-- Please remove the labels (e.g. "Figure 1") from the uploaded image files for the main figures. Please note that labels for parts of the figure such as “(a)” or “(b)” are fine. 

-- Please ensure that figures are uploaded as separate figure files (i.e. one image file for Fig 1, one file for Fig 2…) in one of the following file formats: .jpg, .eps, .tiff or .pdf. Please note that parts of figures, e.g. Figs 1a and 1b, should not be separated. Additionally, please ensure that each of your separate figure files consists of a single page, rather than multiple pages. 

-- Scientific Reports does not use abbreviations lists. Instead, please introduce each abbreviation in the article file text after it is first used, for example: “demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and…” 

-- Please ensure that all authors are individually mentioned in the author contribution statement. Currently, Dungyang Lee does not appear to be mentioned in this statement. 

-- Please could you clarify where the drawing in Figure 1 has been obtained from? If this image was drawn by you or one of your co-authors, please include this information in the “Manuscript Comment” box or alternatively, send an email to SciRep.Admin@nature.com confirming who drew the image.

-- We notice that Table 2 has not been referenced in the main text of the article. If tables are not cited in the manuscript they will not appear in the html (online) version if your paper is accepted for publication. Therefore, it is essential they are mentioned at least once in the text and, we strongly recommend, in the order in which they are numbered.

In addition to this, please can you confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations by including a statement in the methods section to this effect?
