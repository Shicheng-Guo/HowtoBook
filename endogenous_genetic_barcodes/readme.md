Endogenous Genetic Barcodes

We apply slide window method in which windows: 500bp and step 250bp were used to check the numbers of haplotype in 1000 Genome Project. Take chr4 as a example, I found average number of haplotype within 500bp are 3.7 (IQR=3): see:![x](./Figure/HapCount500.png). Obviously, 500bp window have quite limited differentation ability with Endogenous Genetic Barcodes. It looks even with Roche 454 (700bp read length), it is not good enough for the usage.
