Recent, US-CN relationship become worse and worse, especially several very famous Chinese American professor are unders investigation by FBI. My hypothesis is whether US-CN collaboration in Biomedical researchers were affected. Here is the Pubmed publication with US-CN collaboration each month in the past 16 month. We found there were ~1500 papers were published with both USA and China affilations. In addition, we didn't find any publication number gaps in the past 16 month and we neither observed the declined trend for collaboration publication.![pubmed](US_CN_Pubmed.png).
