How to transfer Rmd to MediaWiki in Linux

```{r}
library("knitr")
library("rmarkdown")
rmarkdown::render('DeconvolutionMixture.Rmd')
pandoc("DeconvolutionMixture.md",format="MediaWiki")
```
When you change md to MediaWiki, there will be a fold named figure and the png files will be include in this fold.

Be sure to install pandoc advanced (see my previous note).(https://github.com/Shicheng-Guo/HowtoBook/blob/master/Pandoc.install.Rmd)

If you want to know how to do it in windows, please ask Yihui
