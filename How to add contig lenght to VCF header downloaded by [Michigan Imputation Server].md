#### How to add contig lenght to VCF header downloaded by [Michigan Imputation Server](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/start.html#!pages/home)

Recently, some of my colleagues asked help from me in which they mentioned the contig length information was lost in the imputation files downloaded form [Michigan Imputation Server, 09/01/2019](https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/start.html#!pages/home). I do checked it and found MIS do lost contig length information which usually required by lots of downstream analysis packages, such as GATK.
