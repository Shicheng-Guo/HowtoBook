1. obtain alternative allele frequency table from 1000 genome dataset
```
perl printMAF.pl ALL.wgs.phase3_shapeit2_mvncall_integrated_v5b.20130502.sites.vcf > G1000SNP_MAF.bed
```
2. rank by the allele freqency
```
```
3. match our pre-set SNPs and get the order
```
```
4. sampling with small random numbers nearby the matched orders
```
```
5. calculate the distance and get the distribution of the SNPs to DMERs.
```
```
