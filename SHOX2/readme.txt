Real-time PCR (SYBR Green Assay) for the Analysis of DNA from Tissue Specimens. PCR was carried out using the QuantiTect Multiplex Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Gemany) with 0.3 μM of each primer (forward: GTTTTTTGGATAGTTAGGTAAT, reverse: CCTCCTACCTTCTAACCC), 1 μM blocker (TAATTTTTGTTTTGTTTGTTTGATTGGGGTTGTATGA-SpacerC3), 10 ng DNA template (quantified via UV spectrophotometry) and 1:40,000 diluted SYBR Green I DNA dye (Biozym Scientific, Oldendorf, Germany) in 20 μl per reaction. Real-time PCR was performed on the LC480 platform (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) with the following program: 95°C/10 min, 45 cycles with 95°C/10 sec, 56°C/30 s, 72°C/10 and 82.5°C/5 s (detection step).

Real-time PCR (Probe Assay) for the Analysis of DNA from Lavage Specimens. Real-time PCR assays were comprised of two independent reactions: a total quantification assay for quantification of total input DNA and an HM assay [21] for quantification of methylated target template. The total quantification assay was composed of two methylation-unspecific oligonucleotides and a scorpion primer unspecific for DNA methylation. The methylation quantification assay (HM assay) uses two methylation-unspecific primers, two methylation-specific blockers (one for each primer) and a scorpion primer specific for methylated DNA. The PCR were done in 20 μl volumes (1 × QuantiTect Multiplex PCR NoROX Kit [Qiagen], DNA [0.25 μl DNA from fresh-frozen and 1 μl from Saccomanno-fixed specimens] and oligonucleotides [Table 2]).
