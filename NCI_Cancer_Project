1. TCGA Overview

I have been used TCGA data for quite a while since they have Methylation data.  

2. TARGET Overview

Don't have Methylation data, but including miRNA-seq and RNA-seq

3. CCLE Overview
this dataset is not bad, but only focus on cell line. they have methylation dataset. Can be used for methylation-expression analysis.


4. CGCI Overview
Don't have methylation data, but have:

Whole Genome Sequencing
Whole Exome Sequencing (2nd generation)
Transcriptome Sequencing (2nd generation)
Targeted Gene sequencing (Sanger)
Gene Expression Profiling
Copy Number Analysis (SNP arrays)
