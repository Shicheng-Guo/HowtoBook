While the initial number of variants was stated as being ‘over 500,000’, the subsequent steps of quality control (i.e. genotype call rates, deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)) were just mentioned in the passing, and how these affected the final distribution of the variants based on frequency (i.e. how many is <= 1% (rare variants), 1-10% (moderately common variants) and >= 10% (common variants)) wasn’t mentioned. Can the authors include this information within text? This would be useful to get a sense on how many rare variants there were left before going into phasing as well as a the final number of variants used in the analysis.
