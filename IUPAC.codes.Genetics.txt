IUPAC codes
The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has defined a standard representation of DNA bases by single characters that specify either a single base (e.g. G for guanine, A for adenine) or a set of bases (e.g. R for either G or A). UCSC uses these single character codes to represent multiple observed alleles of single-base polymorphisms.

Symbol	Bases	Origin of designation
G	G	Guanine
A	A	Adenine
T	T	Thymine
C	C	Cytosine
R	G or A	puRine
Y	T or C	pYrimidine
M	A or C	aMino
K	G or T	Keto
S	G or C	Strong interaction (3 H bonds)
W	A or T	Weak interaction (2 H bonds)
H	A or C or T	not-G, H follows G in the alphabet
B	G or T or C	not-A, B follows A
V	G or C or A	not-T (not-U), V follows U
D	G or A or T	not-C, D follows C
N	G or A or T or C	aNy
